The pipeline is now based on official release of qctool (v2.0) and finemap (v1.3) both with minor changes. It is also possible to use approximately independent LD blocks.

**v1.0**

This freezes use of self-compiled qctool (v2.0) and finemap (1.1).

**v1.1**

This freezes the original design using blocks of GNU parallel calls for each finemapping software.
