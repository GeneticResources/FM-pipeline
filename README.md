# FM-pipeline

This is a pipeline for finemapping using GWAS summary statistics, implemented in Bash as a series of steps to furnish an incremental analysis. As depicted in the diagram below 

![**LocusZoom plot showing Regional association for chr1:39114617-39614617**](files/fm.png)

where our lead SNP rs4970634 is in LD with many others, the procedure attempts to identify causal variants from region(s) showing significant SNP-trait association.

The process involves the following steps,
1. Extraction of effect (beta)/z statistics from GWAS summary statistics (.sumstats), 
2. Extraction of correlation from the reference panel among overlapped SNPs from 1 and the reference panel containing individual level data. 
3. Information from 1 and 2 above is then used as input for finemapping.

The measure of evidence is typically (log10) Bayes factor (BF) and associate SNP probability in the causal set.

Software included in this pipeline are listed in the table below.

**Name** | **Function** | **Input** | **Output** | **Reference**
-----|----------|-------|--------|----------
CAVIAR | finemapping | z, correlation matrix | causal sets and probabilities | Hormozdiari, et al. (2014)
CAVIARBF | finemapping | z, correlation matrix | BF and probabilities for all configurations | Chen, et al. (2015)
GCTA | joint/conditional analysis | .sumstats, reference data | association results | Yang, et al. (2012)
FM-summary | finemapping | .sumstats association results | updated results | Huang, et al. (2017)
JAM | finemapping | beta, individual reference data | Bayes Factor of being causal | Newcombe, et al. (2016)
LocusZoom | regional plot | partial .sumstats | .pdf/.png plots | Pruim, et al. (2010)
fgwas | functional GWAS | | | Pickrell (2014)
finemap | finemapping | z, correlation matrix | causal SNPs and configuration | Benner, et al. (2016)

so they range from regional association plots via LocusZoom, joint/conditional analysis via GCTA, functional annotation via fgwas to dedicated finemapping software including CAVIAR, 
CAVIARBF, an adapted version of FM-summary, R2BGLiMS/JAM and finemap. One can optionally use a subset of these for a particular analysis by specifying relevant flags from the 
pipeline's settings.

## INSTALLATION

On many occasions, the pipeline takes advantage of the [GNU parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/).

Besides (sub)set of software listed in the table above, the pipeline requires [qctool](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool/#overview) 2.0,
[PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) 1.9, and the companion program LDstore from finemap's website need to be installed. 

The pipeline itself can be installed in the usual way,
```
git clone https://github.com/jinghuazhao/FM-pipeline
```
The setup is in line with summary statistics from consortia where only RSid are given for the fact that their chromosomal position may be changed
over different builds. To remedy this, we use information from UCSC, e.g.,
```
wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/snp150.txt.gz
gunzip -c snp150.txt.gz | \
awk '{split($2,a,"_");sub(/chr/,"",a[1]);print a[1],$4,$5}' | \
sort -k3,3 > snp150.txt
```
Note that JAM requires Java 1.8 so call to Java -jar inside the function needs to 
reflect this, not straightforward with `install_github()` from `devtools` but one needs to 
clone the package, modify the R source code and then use
```
git clone https://github.com/pjnewcombe/R2BGLiMS
### change java to java-1.8 in R2BGLiMS/R/R2BGLiMS.R
R CMD INSTALL R2BGLiMS
```
Implementations have been done for the finemapping software along with LocusZoom and GCTA; support for fgwas is still alpha tested. To facilitate handling of grapahics, e.g., importing them into Excel, pdftopng from [xpdf](https://www.xpdfreader.com/) is used.

We use [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) and Sun grid engine (sge) for some of the data preparation, which would become handy when available.

## USAGE

Before start, settings at the beginning of the script need to be changed and only minor change is expected after this. The syntax of pipeline is then simply
```
bash fmp.sh <input>
```

## Inputs

### --- GWAS summary statistics ---

These include the following columns,

Column | Name | Description
-------|------|------------
1 | SNP | RSid
2 | A1 | Effect allele
3 | A2 | Other allele
4 | freqA1 | A1 frequency
5 | beta | effect estimate
6 | se | standard error of effect
7 | P | P-value
8 | N | sample size
9*  | chr | chromosome
10* | pos | position

This format is in line with joint/conditional analysis by GCTA. Note the last two columns are not always available but can 
be obtained from UCSC as above; see below for example use.

### --- Reference panel ---

The pipeline uses a reference panel in a .GEN format, taking into account directions of effect in both the GWAS summary statistics and the reference panel. Its 
development will facilitate summary statistics from a variety of consortiua as with reference panels such as the HRC and 1000Genomes.

A .GEN file is required for each region, named such that chr{chr}\_{start}\_{end}.gen, together with a sample file. For our own data, a [utility program in 
Stata](files/st.do) is written to generate such files from their whole chromosome counterpart using SNPinfo.dta.gz which has the following information,

chr |        snpid  |       rsid |    pos |    FreqA2 |    info  | type |  A1  | A2
----|--------------|-------------|--------|-----------|----------|------|------|----
 1  | 1:54591_A_G  | rs561234294 |  54591 |  .0000783 |  .33544  |    0 |   A  |  G  
 1  | 1:55351_T_A  | rs531766459 |  55351 |  .0003424 |   .5033  |    0 |   T  |  A  
... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Optionally, a file is specified which contains samples to be excluded from the reference panel; one leaves it 
unspecified when not needed. In line with qctool -excl-samples option, it contains a list of individuals corresponding 
to ID_2 of the [sample file](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/file_format.html) rather than ID_1 and 
ID_2.

### --- The lead SNPs ---

Given these, one can do away with Stata and work on a text version for instance SNPinfo.txt. An auxiliary file called `st.bed` 
contains chr, start, end, rsid, pos, r corresponding to the lead SNPs specified and r is a sequence number of region. As GCTA 
conditional/joint analysis requires whole chromosome reference the counterpart is [HRC.do](files/HRC.do). Note in this case the snpid 
and rsid variables are called rsid and RSnum instead; both porgrams filter SNPs on minor allele count and measure of imputation 
quality. As it is very slow, we use .bgen instead see the section on WHOLE-GENOME CONDITIONAL/JOINT ANALYSIS below.

## Outputs

The output will involve counterpart(s) from individual software, i.e., .set/post, 
caviarbf, .snp/.config, .jam/.top

Software | Output type | Description
---------|---------------------|------------
CAVIAR   | .set/.post | causal set and probabilities in the causal set/posterior probabilities
CAVIARBF | .caviarbf | causal configurations and their BFs
FM-summary | .txt | additional information to the GWAS summary statistics
JAM      | .jam/.top | the posterior summary table and top models containing selected SNPs
finemap  | .snp/.config | top SNPs with largest log10(BF) and top configurations as with their log10(BF)

It is helpful to examine directions of effects together with their correlation which is now embedded as with finemap.


## WHOLE-GENOME CONDITIONAL/JOINT ANALYSIS

As the pipeline works on regsions defined by lead SNPs, it is desirable to have a genomewide counterpart and currently this
is possible with GCTA and we have a script called [gcta-slct.sh](gcta-slct.sh) which accepts a single sumstats file, and only
a minor change is required, namely,
```
gcta-slct.sh <input>
```
At the end of the script, it also shows how the relevant information was generated. As it is very time-consuming for
interactive use, on our system we resort to sge, e.g.,
```
qsub -S /bin/bash -V -N HRC -cwd -e HRC.err -o HRC.out -pe make 10 -q all.q /genetics/bin/gcta-slct.sh HRC
```
so the job is sent to the clusters instead.

The use of gene list from the analysis can be fed into VEGAS2v2 as shown with [vegas2v2.sh](vegas2v2.sh) but some changes
are required for the command-line version described at the of the script. We don't have experiences with the web-based 
interface from [https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/](https://vegas2.qimrberghofer.edu.au/). Nevertheless, as indicated
in the original VEGAS paper (Liu et al. 2010), ``If a gene contains only one causal variant, then the inclusion of a large
number of nonsignificant markers into the gene-based test will dilute this geneâ€™s significance.``

However, more broadly software in PW-pipeline can be used and in terms of LD information PASCAL will be useful.

## EXAMPLE

We show how to set up for BMI GWAS summary data as reported by the GIANT consortium, Locke, et al. (2015),
```
# GWAS summary statistics
wget http://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/images/1/15/SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq.gz
gunzip -c SNP_gwas_mc_merge_nogc.tbl.uniq.gz |
awk 'NR>1' | \
join -11 -23 - snp150.txt | \
awk '($9!="X" && $9!="Un")' > bmi.txt

# A list of 97 SNPs
R --no-save <<END
library(openxlsx)
xlsx <- "https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7538/extref/nature14177-s2.xlsx"
snps <- read.xlsx(xlsx, sheet = 4, colNames=FALSE, skipEmptyRows = FALSE, cols = 1, rows = 5:101)
snplist <- sort(as.vector(snps[,1]))
write.table(snplist, file="97.snps", row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE, quote=FALSE)
END

# st.bed
grep -w -f 97.snps snp150.txt | \
sort -k1,1n -k2,2n | \
awk -vflanking=250000 '{print $1,$2-flanking,$2+flanking,$3,$2,NR}' > st.bed
```
where we download the GWAS summary statistics adding SNP positions in build 37 rather than 36. The list of SNPs can also be used to generate st.bed as above.

We illustrate use of 1000Genomes data, available as [FUSION LD reference panel](https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/FUSION/LDREF.tar.bz2), with
[1KG.sh](1KG/1KG.sh) to generate `SNPinfo.dta.gz` and [st.do](1KG/st.do) to generate the required data.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The work was motivated by finemapping analysis at the MRC Epidemiology Unit and inputs from authors of GCTA, finemap, JAM, FM-summary as with participants in the 
Physalia course `Practical GWAS Using Linux and R` are greatly appreciated. In particular, the [utility program in Stata](files/st.do) was adapted from 
[p0.do](files/p0.do) (which is still used when LD_MAGIC is enabled) originally written by Dr Jian'an Luan and 
[computeCorrelationsImpute2forFINEMAP.r](files/computeCorrelationsImpute2forFINEMAP.r) by Ji Chen from the MAGIC consortium who also provides code calculating the 
credible set based on finemap configurations. Earlier version of the pipeline also used [GTOOL](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/%7Ecfreeman/software/gwas/gtool.html).
