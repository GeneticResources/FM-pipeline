Hi Jinghua,

Thank you for your interests in my fine-mapping algorithm and code. 

This method takes a list of SNPs in a locus known to be associated to a disease. It calculates the posterior probability for 
each SNP (column probNorm), and whether the SNP is in 'credible set’ (column inCredible). The R2 is highly recommended for 
controlling the secondary associations. I noticed that you applied the code to SNPs from multiple loci, which is not the 
intended use for this approach. 

I’ve attached a manuscript discussing this method and its application. In summary, you need to 
1) apply this method to one locus at a time
2) for each locus, you need to provide a full list of SNP (imputed)
