This code is adapted from https://github.com/hailianghuang/FM-summary.

The method takes a list of SNPs in a locus known to be associated to a disease. It calculates the posterior 
probability for each SNP (column probNorm), and whether the SNP is in 'credible setâ€™ (column inCredible). The R2 in 
the original FM-summary is highly recommended for controlling the secondary associations.

One needs to 

1) apply this method to one locus at a time
2) provide a full list of SNPs (imputed) for each locus
