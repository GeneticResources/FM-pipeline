This method takes a list of SNPs in a locus known to be associated to a disease. It calculates the posterior probability for 
each SNP (column probNorm), and whether the SNP is in 'credible setâ€™ (column inCredible). The R2 is highly recommended for 
controlling the secondary associations.

One needs to 

1) apply this method to one locus at a time
2) for each locus, you need to provide a full list of SNP (imputed)
